# JavaScriptEngine
## What is this repository all about?

Hello gorgeous 💅👁️👄👁️💅
<br> You probably landed here from my LinkedIn or Medium. Welcome to the dark corners of my learning process 🔮 

The files you will find within this repository come from my quest to understand how the JS engine works,
how it compiles source code, and finally how the scoping chain works.

You might be wondering *'Why??'* and the answer is that all of this comes from:
1. My insatiable, restless curiosity;
2. The importance of reading your own code like JavaScript would read it. This helps to spot what could be wrong when you have a bug.
3. The *'return'* and the *'this'* keyword making no sense to me. I got to a point on my learning that sure, I can implement these two and make them work, but I couldn't REALLY understand what was *'this'* and where TF where I returning from. 

Please start to read from page 1 to 3. If you know enough about the Engine, of course you can skip to the scoping files.

I carefully wrote all of this text through Obsidian, and made the illustrations using Miro board.
The version control is all on me, Git, GitHub Desktop and GitHub.
The other repositories you will find here are just me keeping my studies somewhere on the internet in case global warming gets rly bad and my Mac explodes.

My sources were:
- Udemy's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!", by Jonas Schmedtmann;
- This video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZveW4_ZJtVY that is on the API part;
- The book "You Don't Know JS Yet: Scope & Closures - 2nd Edition";
- The paper "Scoped: Visualising the scope chain within source code · June 2017";
- The first 3 images on part 1 I got from google, the API one I got from the video above.
- All of the other images were carefully crafted by my beautiful a$$.

If you prefer to read this work on your own Obsidian you can download it through these links:
- Page 1: obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=JavaScript%20Engine%2F1%20-%20(Draft)%20JavaScript%20Engine
- Page 2: obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=JavaScript%20Engine%2F2%20-%20JavaScript%20scope%20chain
- Page 3: obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Vault&file=JavaScript%20Engine%2F3%20-%20JavaScript%20scoping%20in%20practice
- And download the images folder from here.

You can also just navigate through it here on GitHub. I must say that the visual experience is way sexier on Obsidian.

Get yourself some water you beautiful dehydrated blob.
<br>Then sit back, relax, and enjoy this learning ride through the corners of my brain 👩🏻‍🚀🚀
